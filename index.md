## Overview
**DSAS2026 – Dependable and Secure Autonomous Systems** is a **full-day workshop at DSN 2026** focusing on the dependability and security of **autonomous systems** across:
- **Space systems** (satellites, ground segment, space-enabled services)
- **Drone/UAV systems** (autonomous aerial platforms, swarms, resilient navigation)

The workshop emphasizes the impact of **AI/ML-enabled autonomy** on assurance, robustness, safety, and resilience, and brings together researchers working on dependable systems, security, cyber-physical systems, and autonomous platforms.

## Topics of Interest
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:


**Dependability and Security of Space Systems**

- Fault tolerance, resilience, and survivability of space platforms
- Failure modeling and dependability analysis under space-specific constraints
- Secure and dependable ground–space and inter-satellite communications
- Jamming, spoofing, and interference resilience
- Mission assurance and lifecycle dependability (launch, operations, decommissioning)

**Dependability and Security of Drone/UAV Systems**

- Fault tolerance and resilient autonomy for UAVs under resource and energy constraints
- Secure navigation and sensing (e.g., spoofing/jamming resilience, sensor fusion)
- Safety assurance, failsafe behaviors, and graceful degradation (e.g., safe landing modes)
- Dependability and security of drone swarms / multi-agent coordination
- Empirical studies, datasets, and testbeds for UAV reliability and security

**AI/ML in Space and Drone/UAV Systems**

- Dependability and robustness of AI/ML-enabled space components
- Verification, validation, and certification of learning-based space systems
- AI-driven autonomy, planning, and control under uncertainty
- Adversarial ML threats in space environments
- Trust, explainability, and runtime monitoring for AI in space missions
- Human–AI interaction and decision-making in mission-critical space operations

**Cross-Cutting Themes**

- Metrics, benchmarks, and datasets for space system dependability and security
- Secure software and hardware supply chains for space technologies
- Resilience and recovery from on-orbit anomalies or cyber-physical attacks
- Case studies and lessons learned from open, unclassified space missions
