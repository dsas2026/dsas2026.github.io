## Overview
**DSAS2026 – Dependable and Secure Autonomous Systems** is a **full-day workshop at DSN 2026** focused on the dependability and security of **autonomous systems** across:
- **Space systems** (satellites, ground segment, space-enabled services)
- **Drone/UAV systems** (autonomous aerial platforms, swarms, resilient navigation)

The workshop emphasizes the impact of **AI/ML-enabled autonomy** on assurance, robustness, safety, and resilience, and brings together researchers working on dependable systems, security, cyber-physical systems, and autonomous platforms.

## Topics of Interest
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Dependability, fault tolerance, and resilience for autonomous space and UAV systems  
- Secure sensing and communications; **spoofing and jamming resilience**  
- AI/ML assurance: robustness, adversarial ML, runtime monitoring  
- Verification, validation, and certification of learning-enabled autonomy  
- Swarms and multi-agent dependability and security  
- Incident response, recovery, and mission assurance  
- Metrics, benchmarks, datasets, and open testbeds
