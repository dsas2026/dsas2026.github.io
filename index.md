## Overview
**DSAS2026** is a full-day workshop proposed for **DSN 2026** focused on the dependability and security of **autonomous systems** spanning:
- **Space systems** (satellites, ground segment, space-enabled services)
- **Drone/UAV systems** (autonomous aerial platforms, swarms, resilient navigation)

Modern **AI/ML** is transforming autonomy, fault management, and perception—introducing new assurance challenges (robustness, verification, monitoring) and new attack surfaces (spoofing, jamming, adversarial inputs).

## Open Research Only
This workshop accepts **open, unclassified research** only. Submissions must be suitable for open academic publication.

## Topics of Interest
- Dependability, fault tolerance, and resilience for autonomous space and UAV systems  
- Secure sensing/communications; **spoofing/jamming** resilience  
- AI/ML assurance: robustness, adversarial ML, runtime monitoring  
- Verification/validation/certification of learning-enabled autonomy  
- Swarms and multi-agent dependability and security  
- Incident response, recovery, and mission assurance  
- Metrics, benchmarks, datasets, and open testbeds  

## Important Dates
Dates will be posted here once finalized:
- Submission: **March 15, 2026 AoE**
- Notification: **April 15, 2026, AoE**
- Camera-ready: **April 27, 2026, AoE (hard deadline)**
- Workshop day: **June 22, 2026 (tentative)**
